# BootCamp Overflow

## Purpose
Create a comfortable place for current BootCamp students to ask for assistance in their BootCamp course. 

## Motivation for Development:
There arenâ€™t many platforms available specfically for students enrolled in a BootCamp course to ask for assistance in a website free of judgement and the ability to stay anonymous. 

## User Story
As A BootCamp student,

I'D like to be able to connect and contribute to other students who are taking a Bootcamp course

AND have the ability to remain anonymous

SO that we can all assist each other with general understanding of full stack development and succeed in our BootCamp course.
